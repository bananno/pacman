# PACMAN

## Technology

This game is written in plain JavaScript with jQuery. There is no backend/server side.

I built a simple assertion function for running tests on this project. To run tests, open devtools console and run:

```devMode()```

## Game Mechanics

Most of the code is for the ghost AI. These article describe how the ghosts should behave from the game-player's perspective:
